Tabs

The user sees a row of tabs above a content area. When the user clicks on one of the tabs, the content in the content area changes based on which tab the user clicked.

The user can click on a tab to make content appear then reclick the lab to make the same content disappear. The user can have multiple tabs up at one and have all the content per Attack On Titans character appear all at one!
